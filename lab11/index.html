	<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals Challenges</h1>
	<p>For this lab, we are to create a function that depends on conditionals. This means that we'll be doing fancy stuff with numbers in our Javascript. </p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The only issue I had with this lab was with the content. I did not follow directions and use the Sorting Hat as we required. Personally, I did not feel comfortable supporting J.K.Rowling and her content as she is transphobic and openly vocal about her negative opinons about the queer and trans community. As a queer person myself, it feels ironic to be supporting her content as it offends not only me, but those around me. Just wanted to make that clear.</p>

	<p>All of the other parts should be the same and the function still works as it supposed too. Instead of the sorting hat, I chose to "suggest" Halloween classics based on the user's input. It works the same way as the sorting hat feature and takes the input value and outputs one of the answers. This option is a lot more interactive and none of these are offensive. Grab some popcorn and Enjoy!</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This is our final website! Here is a direct link to our <a href="https://valramirez.github.io/cst252/lab11/js/lab.js">javascript code</a>  Below is what we scripted. </p>
