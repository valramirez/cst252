			<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<p>For this assignment we were required to experiment with web scripting and manipulating the DOM using Javascript.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This assignment was a bit difficult because I had forgotten how to do most of this, but I was able to work together with my lab bro Caden who walked me through the process. He also helped me figure out the notes as well! Much appreciated dude.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Below is a screenshot of what our javascript looks like. It's got comments and whitespace so it doesn't give you a headache. </p>

			<p>You can find the link to the <a href="https://valeramirez.github.io/cst252/lab8/js/lab9.js">Javascript source</a> right here.</p>

			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<p>When all of this is over, I want to go on a picninc date with my partner.</p>

			<p>And hold hands and watch the sun setting together</p>
