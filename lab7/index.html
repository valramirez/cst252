			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			<p>For this lab, we are required to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>To me the Javascript information was a bit difficult to remember so I had to refrence w3chools quite frequently. I also had a bit of trouble making the window prompt show up as well. In the end, my partner and I collaborated on the script where he did most of the work. Thanks Bro!</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here is a screenshot of the final html for this assignment.</a></p>

			<p>This is the next step we coded, its the same coding as in the console, but its written out in Atom. All credit to my very humble and smart lab partner who helped me figure out how to make this work. </p>
