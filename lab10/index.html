			<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<p>For this lab, we are doing the same thing from Lab 7, which to make a window appear, but add some seasoning. Now this has some flavor.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>We mostly did this in class together as group so I referred to to what we had written in out javascript at the time. I did had some difficulty with getting the input to work at first but we were able figure it out.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This is our final website! Here is a direct link to our <a href="https://valramirez.github.io/cst252/lab10/js/lab.js">javascript code</a>  Below is what we scripted. </p>

	<h2>UPDATE 10/13/2020</h2>
	<p> So during our time in Lab 13, I went back and fixed an issue with this page. For this assignment, we were required to make the user input take the value and scramble it in an array and at the time I did not know how to do that. After going back through my notes, I included the sorting function from Lab 7 and changed some of the elements so that everything would work properly. Thankfully it works fine now! </p>
