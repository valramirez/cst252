		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<p>The purposse of this lab is to demonstrate our understanding of keeping an orgainzed file structure to make sure that all our files are where they are supposed to be.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was very simple because everything was done for us. I remember a small amount from CST 251 when learning HTML so I guess that was the only real issue that I had while working on this assignment. I did have some problems with adding images and stylizing them to look a certain way on my homepage so thankfully w3schools was able to help me out woth that.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is a screenshot of the file structure that we  "created" and how it is organized. Every lab has its own seperate html file and folders for css and javascript. Overall I think my partner and I did a pretty good job.</p>
