			<h1>Lab 13: Basic Debugging</h1>
			<p>For this lab, we are required to go back and fix our previous labs that did not function like they were supposed to. These are simple fixes that are not too important but help witht he functionality of the site.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab kind of took me a while to complete because I would often be frustrated with myself and my ability to make things work. Thankfully I was able to fix the labs that I needed. But in case you were wondereing, I did shed a couple of tears over this assignment. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here are the labs that I was able to fix with assignment.</p>

			<h2>.⋅ ̣˚ : ✧ ̣˚ : ⭒  Lab 9  ⭒ : ˚̣ ✧ : ˚̣ ⋅.</h2>

			<div class="row">
			  <div class="column">
			    <img src="img/lab9-before.png" alt="lab 9 before" style="width:100%">
			  </div>
			  <div class="column">
			    <img src="img/lab9-after.png" alt="lab 9 after" style="width:100%">
			  </div>
			</div>

					<p>For this assignment, the elements we scripted would not show up on the page as we wanted them to appear. For some reason they would show up all the way after what seems to be the div id=”content” since it is shown underneath the green box. To fix this, I simply created a div in which the script would be placed. That way it shows up at where it needs to be.

					<h2>.⋅ ̣˚ : ✧ ̣˚ : ⭒  Lab 10  ⭒ : ˚̣ ✧ : ˚̣ ⋅.</h2>

			<div class="row">
			  <div class="column">
			    <img src="img/lab10-before.png" alt="lab 10 before" style="width:100%">
			  </div>
			  <div class="column">
			    <img src="img/lab10-after.png" alt="lab 10 after" style="width:100%">
			  </div>
			</div>

					<p>For this assignment, we were required to make the user input take the value and scramble it in an array and at the time I did not know how to do that. After going back through my notes, I included the sorting function from Lab 7 and changed some of the elements so that everything would work properly. Thankfully it works fine now!Here is a direct link to <a href="https://valramirez.github.io/cst252/lab10/index">Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms.</a></p>
