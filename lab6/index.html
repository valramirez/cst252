			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<p>For this assignment we had to create arrays and objects in Javascript with details about our methods of transportation.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This assignment was a bit challenging because it was a lot information to take in and my brain forgot most of it. Thankfully I took notes during the lecture so I was able to go back and look for the information I needed. What was also helpful for this lab were the screenshots providided to us so we could replicate the information that was on the page.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Below is the javascript task we coded in the console in the inspect tab. You can find the link to the <a href="https://valeramirez.github.io/cst252/lab6/js/lab6.js">Javascript source right here.</a></p>

			<p>This is the next step we coded, its the same coding as in the console, but its written out in Atom.</p>

			<p> Here is the final output of what we scripted. Pretty cool right?</p>
