	<p>Hi, I'm Val! I had two dogs and a cat and I am from the Bay Area. I am currently a Junior CD student with concentration in Vsiual Design. I think Web Desgin is pretty difficult so fingers crossed I can pass this class while working remotely! For this assignment I am working with my lab partner Caden to figure this out.</p>
	<p>Hi I'm Caden! I am a Communication Design major with a concentration in Visual Design. I would love to become proficient in web design because digital coding is not my strong suit, and I would love by the end of this class to have created my online store. I have 3 cats, 2 rabbits, 3 snakes, one bearded dragon, and one blind duck. We love animals!</p>
